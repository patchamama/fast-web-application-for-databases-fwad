    <note><![CDATA[Some notes from brothercake (thanks bro!):
  ---
  Looks good as far as Opera's concerned, but Konqueror spoofs document.all, and can also identify as IE, so you'd need to add navigator.vendor != 'KDE' to your second test; but with that addition you no longer need to look for "msie" in the user agent string - having tested for document.all and not konqueror, and already knowing we're not Opera, only IE is left; then you can separate IE4 from IE5+ by testing for getElementById or another DOM1 collection.
  
  Your gecko test will also identify Safari (which has "like gecko" in its UA string), and Konqueror if it's identifying as gecko - you could test against that with navigator.vendor again, but that wouldn't allow for gecko spoofing as something else  - afaik there is no way to identify gecko reliably.
  
  Why have a mac test? Do you need to know that someone's using a mac, over and above that they're using mac/ie5?  For mac ie5 you can test (established IE) against window.attachEvent.
  
  So all in all - the only UA information we really need is to identify Opera versions 
  cheers
